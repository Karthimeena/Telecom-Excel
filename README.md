# Telecom-Excel
This is the Advanced Excel Dashboard project for AtliqO Telecom domain 
Provide insights to the executive team in the Telecom domain

AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

AtliQoâ€™s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre- and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to get more active users.

ðŸ’§ To obtain these results from the given data set, I implemented the following techniques:

âž¡ VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP - Used to perform data lookup and retrieval, merging data from different tables sources

âž¡SUM, SUMIF, AVG, AVGIF - Performed arithmetic calculations on the given data set to present the data in a clear way

âž¡Conditional Formatting - Applied this to highlight the better and poor performance

âž¡Data Model - Created relationships between the tables

âž¡Pivot tables - Created measures for calculations and Applied filters 

âž¡ Chart - Utilized different types of chart that were best suited to present the data and effectively communicate the results.

These approaches helped me analyze the data effectively and derive meaningful insights from it.
